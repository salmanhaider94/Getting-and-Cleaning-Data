# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

# in first part i Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# then i extracted only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# later on i used descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# I Appropriately labeled the data set with descriptive variable names.
# lastly from the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable
